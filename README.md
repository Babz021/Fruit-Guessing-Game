# Hangman Project 
The Hangman project is a Python-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game. The objective of the game is for the player to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts (lives). If the player correctly guesses a letter, it is revealed in the word. However, if the guess is incorrect, they lose a life. The game ends when the player either successfully guesses all the letters in the word or runs out of lives.
