# Fruit-Guessing-Game
This is a simple fruit guessing game written in Python. The program randomly selects a fruit from a predefined list, and the user is prompted to guess a single letter. The aim of the project is to demonstrate basic Python concepts such as list handling, user input, conditionals, and the `random` module.
